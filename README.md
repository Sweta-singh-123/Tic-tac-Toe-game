# Tic-tac-Toe-game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and popular two-player game, typically played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking the spaces with their respective symbols, traditionally "X" and "O." The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a straight line of three of their symbols, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Game Setup:
Players: 2
Player 1 uses "X"
Player 2 uses "O"
Grid: A 3x3 grid, which consists of 9 spaces.
Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
Turn-Based Play: Players alternate turns, with Player 1 starting by placing an "X" in any one of the 9 available spaces.
Objective: The goal is to align three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.
Winning the Game:
A player wins if they can place three of their marks in a straight line: either in a row, a column, or along one of the two diagonals.
Draw (Tie): If all nine spaces are filled without a player completing a line of three, the game ends in a draw.
No Overwriting: Once a player places their symbol in a space, it cannot be changed.
